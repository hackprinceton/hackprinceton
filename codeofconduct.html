  <h1>HackPrinceton Code of Conduct</h1>

  See this page? It's a metaphor. We've left if raw and to the point; there are no pretty bells or whistles. It means business. Just like our code of conduct. Do NOT break or even skirt these rules. See how responsive this webpage is? Bingo. That's how we'll be too.

<br><br>

All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.

<br><br>

tl;dr: Donâ€™t be a Jerk

<br><br>

Here at HackPrinceton, we're dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form, including but not limited to verbal and online comments, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.  Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the HackPrinceton organisers.

<br><br>

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

<br><br>

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

<br><br>

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

<br><br>

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an organizer immediately. Organizers can be identified as they'll be wearing branded t-shirts.

<br><br>

Organizers will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.

<br><br>

We expect participants to follow these rules at HackPrinceton and all related events, including travel to and from the venue.
