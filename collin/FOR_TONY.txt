This website is really a Jekyll blog, which is convenient because Github can host Jekyll blogs natively. 
We don't have to use any of the blog functionality, of course, so we can probably scrap all of that.
That means a little bit of cleanup (well, that's a given because there are a lot of unnecessary files here),
but I can take care of that tonight or tomorrow. I just finished the responsive layout this morning, so we
should be all ready to go and add content!
