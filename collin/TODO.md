#### A list of known issues and/or remaining steps to complete in the development process (organized by priority)

##### High
* Disable horizontal scroll event handler when vertical scroll is detected.
* Add 'bounce' effect to scroll endpoints, thus preventing annoying Mac page navigation
* Race condition? Easier to see on Firefox
* TEST CROSS-BROWSER

##### Medium
* Animation on menu buttons (slide out and increase font size with recoloring)

##### Low
* Look into private server (VPS)
