  <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
  <p>
    I am a rising senior majoring in computer science at Princeton University. Relevant coursework includes networking, HCI, computational and algorithmic reasoning, functional and object-oriented programming, and system design.
  </p>
  <p>
    This summer I'm an intern for Microsoft's Bing team. I previously interned at TripAdvisor as a member of the product personalization team.
  </p>
  <p>
    Studying computer science was a gut decision for me. I started my career at Princeton as an aerospace engineer and changed majors after having my mind blown by an introductory course in Java. I've never looked back.
  </p>
  <p>
    My current area of focus is on technologies which do a better job of collecting or presenting data in context. These technologies include "smart things" and wearables, note-taking and personal efficiency applications, and content recommendation systems. I want computers to see me as more than a bag of words or properties. Success will yield a digital world which is more intuitive and accessible from our own.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm also interested in digital rights and the structure of the Internet Society. In particular, I wish to study how the interaction of technology and policy affects the expression of individuals and groups on the Internet. I want to design "socially conscientious technologies" which improve the nature of communication among digital neighbors.
  </p>
  <p>
    In my free time I like to juggle, play poker, and Make Things. I'm also an avid hackathon attendee. I do much of my web development with a CERN stack (Cassandra, Express, React, Node.js).
