            <dt>What if I don't have any experience?</dt>
            <dd>That is fantastic! At HackPrinceton, you'll have so many people to meet, so much to learn and the most of fun to be had. We will have a top shelf team of veteran mentors to help you hit the ground running with ideas and guidance, plenty of opportunities to engage other talented and curious individuals like yourself and of course lots and lots of fun events right when you hit that rough patch. At HackPrinceton, we believe a hackathon does not necessarily have to be restricted to hundreds of people coding mobile apps and websites but rather a learning and sociable experience for people of all walks in life.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt>Who can participate?</dt>
            <dd>HackPrinceton is open to all students currently enrolled in a college or university. It doesn't matter if you have never been to a hackathon before--there's a first time for everything! The event is open to students of all majors and minors; no Computer Science degree needed! Unfortunately, we cannot accept high schoolers right now due to liability reasons with the University. </dd>
            <br>
            <dt>Do I need an idea to sign up?</dt>
            <dd>No problem at all. Coming up with ideas is hard so don't feel discouraged if you don't immediately have the blueprints for the next Dropbox or Flappy Bird dancing around in your head the second you get here. This spring, we are specifically structuring our hackathon to have direct, personal interactions between experienced mentors and teams of hackers. If you don't have your million dollar idea just yet, in their infinite wisdom our mentors will help you brainstorm and work together with you to bring your project to life.</dd>

            <dt>How do I get to Princeton?</dt>
            <dd>We offer travel reimbursements of up to $100 per visiting students as needed. Reimbursements will only be granted if a project is completed and submitted. We'll also be sending buses out for participants near Buffalo, McGill, MIT, and UMD; look out for an email from your local organizer for more information!</dd>
            <br>
            <dt>Will there be food?</dt>
            <dd>Yes! Lots and lots of food. We'll provide all meals, with vegetarian options. We aim to make the experience as seamless as possible. All you have to worry about is building something!</dd>
            <br>
            <dt>Do I need a team to sign up?</dt>
            <dd>Nope! We will have sessions to help people find team members and/or form teams, as well as an idea generation workshop to help people think of ideas to work on for the hackathon. So you should sign up regardless!</dd>
            <br>
            <dt>What should I bring?</dt>
            <dd>Laptop, cellphone, chargers. Non-Princeton students should alsso bring a change of clothes, and toiletries. And bring your friends and teammates!</dd>
            <br>
            <dt>Where will I be working?</dt>
            <dd>The event will be based in our athletic center, Jadwin Gym! Hardware teams will have access to our undergrad EE lab as well. More details forthcoming.</dd>
