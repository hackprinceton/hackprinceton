  <h1>HackPrinceton Code of Conduct</h1>

Look at this page. No sugarcoat. It means business, as do we. All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at HackPrinceton are required to agree with the following code of conduct. And the best part of this page? It's wonderfully responsive, as will be the organizers in dealing with harassment.

<br><br><br>

tl;dr: Donâ€™t be a Jerk

<br><br>

Here at HackPrinceton, we're dedicated to providing a safe and harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form, including but not limited to verbal and online comments, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.  Conference participants violating the following rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the HackPrinceton organisers.

<br><br>

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

<br><br>

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

<br><br>

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

<br><br>

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an organizer immediately. Organizers can be identified as they'll be wearing branded t-shirts.

<br><br>

Organizers will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.

<br><br>

We expect these rules to be maintained at HackPrinceton and all related events, such as travel to and from the venue.
